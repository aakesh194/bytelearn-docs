**<span style="font-size:25px;">How to Ask a Math Question</span>**

**Using Prefixes:**
Type your Math problem starting with the prefix question or `“Question:”` This is probably the most efficient way in asking your problem.

>**For example:**
`Question: What is 2+2?`
<br>If your question includes an image of the problem, simply attach the image after the prefix. The bot is capable of interpreting and solving math problems from images as well. 

**Using the Slash Command:**
`</ask-byte>`

+ Initiate a command by typing `/` in the chat. The `ask-byte` command should appear in the suggestion box. Select it or type `/ask-byte` to activate.
+ You will be presented with two options: `question_image` and `question_text`.
	+ `question_text`: Use this to manually type in your question and receive the answer
	+ `question_image`: Use this to submit an image of your problem and receive the answer
+ If your image needs additional context or if the image contains the entire problem statement and you wish to add more details, first upload the image, then select `question_text` to type in any supplementary information. *Ensure all text is entered in the prompted input box, not the general chat.*

?>**<span style="font-size:21px;">Important Tips</span>**
<br>• The problem you ask should contain the instructions for what needs to be done. Incomplete problem statements produce poor-quality solutions.
<br>• Ask one problem at a time. Asking multiple questions or lengthy questions might not give optimal results.
<br>• The bot cannot solve problems that involve graphs, tables, and diagrams.

**User Limits**

Each user is allowed to ask up to 10 questions per day to manage demand and ensure quality responses.
