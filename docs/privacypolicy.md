### Data collected automatically
This data is kept only for its stated functionality. 
- The bot will await and monitor messages sent in the server until it detects the keyword `Question`. Once detected, it will perform the action of using Bytelearn API to solve the problem used with the keyword.
- The bot will be invoked directly when `/ask-byte` slash command is used. The bot will again use Bytelearn API to solve the problem.
If you do not consent to this feature of the bot scanning of your messages, you may choose to remove the bot from its server permissions.

### Data collected by command
The following items are collected and stored when the bot is invoked. This data is not collected automatically.
- Your Discord user ID
- Your input as with slash command or keyword
- The message ID in which bot was invoked and reply to the message
- Time and date of invoked messages sent
- Any data needed for standard operation of bot such as server permissions and is stored as cache only while bot is running.

We collect user and message ID so that we can reply to the message. The bot may also store information for up to 24 hours relating to the user due to our credits system of limiting users to 10 questions a day.
